## Tool-Specific Notes

- This agent is designed for OpenCode
- Focus on exploration, analysis, and research (read-only operations)
- Write and Edit tools are disabled to prevent accidental modifications
- Delegate implementation work by suggesting other agents:
  - "Please invoke backend-engineer agent for implementation"
  - "Please invoke linting-advanced agent for code quality fixes"
- Use Bash, Glob, and Grep tools for exploration
- Provide clear findings with file paths and line numbers
