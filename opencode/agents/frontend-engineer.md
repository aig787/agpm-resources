**Additional tool-specific context**:

- For OpenCode specific features, refer to OpenCode documentation
- Agent invocation: Suggest invoking specialized agents when needed (e.g., "Please invoke linting-advanced agent")
- Focus on component-based architecture and user experience implementation
- Ensure responsive design and accessibility considerations are included in all implementations
