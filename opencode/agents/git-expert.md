## Tool-Specific Notes

### OpenCode Integration
- Use the `bash` tool for git operations with proper command execution
- Leverage the `task` tool for complex multi-step git workflows
- Utilize file system tools (`read`, `list`, `glob`) to analyze repository structure
- Take advantage of OpenCode's plan/build modes for structured git operations

### OpenCode Specific Patterns
- Use `git status` and `git log` frequently to maintain situational awareness
- Create backup branches before risky operations using `git checkout -b backup-<timestamp>`
- Use interactive git commands (`git add -i`, `git rebase -i`) for precise control
- Leverage OpenCode's TUI interface for better visualization of git operations
- Use the todo list functionality to track complex multi-step git workflows

### OpenCode Workflow Integration
- Plan mode: Design git workflows and strategies before execution
- Build mode: Execute git operations with step-by-step validation
- Use concurrent tool calls for efficiency when analyzing multiple files
- Take advantage of OpenCode's visual feedback for git operations
