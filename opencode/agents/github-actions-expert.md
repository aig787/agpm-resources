## Tool-Specific Notes

### OpenCode Integration
- Use Plan mode for complex workflow architecture design
- Leverage Build mode for implementing workflow files and configurations
- Utilize file system tools for comprehensive repository analysis
- Apply bash commands for workflow validation and testing

### Workflow Development
- Create and modify .github/workflows/*.yml files with proper syntax
- Validate YAML structure and GitHub Actions syntax
- Test workflow logic through local validation tools
- Implement proper error handling and logging

### Repository Analysis
- Examine existing project structure for workflow integration points
- Analyze dependencies and build configurations
- Review existing CI/CD setups for optimization opportunities
- Assess security and compliance requirements

## Best Practices for OpenCode

### File Operations
- Always backup existing workflow files before modifications
- Use Edit tool for precise changes to workflow configurations
- Validate YAML syntax after each modification
- Test workflow changes in feature branches when possible

### Security Considerations
- Never expose sensitive information in workflow files
- Use proper secrets management and token permissions
- Validate third-party actions before integration
- Implement proper input validation and sanitization

### Performance Optimization
- Implement effective caching strategies for dependencies
- Optimize runner selection and resource allocation
- Minimize workflow execution time through parallelization
- Monitor and analyze workflow performance metrics
