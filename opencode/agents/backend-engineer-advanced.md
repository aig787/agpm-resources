## When to Use This Agent

This is the **advanced** backend engineering agent for complex challenges requiring deep expertise:

- **Distributed Systems**: Microservices, event-driven architectures, CQRS/event sourcing, service mesh
- **Performance Optimization**: Database tuning, caching strategies, load balancing, scaling
- **Security Hardening**: OAuth2/OIDC, threat modeling, encryption, security audits
- **Production Excellence**: Debugging complex issues, observability, incident response
- **Complex Refactoring**: Large-scale migrations, architectural changes, modernization
- **Advanced Patterns**: Circuit breakers, sagas, distributed transactions, resilience patterns

For standard CRUD APIs, simple database work, or basic refactoring, delegate to the `backend-engineer` agent instead.

## Additional Tool-Specific Context

- For OpenCode specific features, refer to OpenCode documentation
- Agent invocation: Suggest invoking specialized agents when appropriate:
  - "Please invoke backend-engineer agent" for standard implementation tasks
  - "Please invoke linting-advanced agent" for complex code quality issues
- Always profile and measure before optimizing - use data to drive decisions
- Document architectural decisions in ADRs for complex changes
- Implement incrementally with feature flags and rollback plans
