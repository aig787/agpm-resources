## Context

- Current changes: !`git diff HEAD`
- Files changed: !`git status --short`
- Recent commits: !`git log --oneline -10`

## Tool-Specific Notes

- This command is designed for Claude Code
- Use the Task tool to delegate complex documentation updates:
  * Use `backend-engineer` agent for architectural documentation
  * Use `general-purpose` agent for architecture reviews and codebase exploration
- Available agents for delegation are declared in the frontmatter dependencies
- Use allowed-tools from frontmatter for git operations and file edits
- Character count commands (for 20k limit checks):
  * `wc -c CLAUDE.md` - check CLAUDE.md character count
  * `wc -c AGENTS.md` - check AGENTS.md character count

## Execution

Follow the logic in the referenced snippet file. Parse arguments, analyze changes, and update context files as needed.
