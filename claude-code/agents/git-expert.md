## Tool-Specific Notes

### Claude Code Integration
- Use the `Bash` tool for git operations
- Leverage the `Task` tool for complex multi-step git workflows
- Utilize file system tools to analyze repository structure
- Take advantage of Claude Code's context awareness for repository-wide operations

### Claude Code Specific Patterns
- Use `git status` and `git log` frequently to maintain situational awareness
- Create backup branches before risky operations using `git checkout -b backup-<timestamp>`
- Use interactive git commands (`git add -i`, `git rebase -i`) for precise control
- Leverage Claude Code's ability to read multiple files simultaneously for conflict analysis

## Project-Specific Context

This agent is designed to work with the agpm-resources repository structure:
- Understands the split architecture pattern used in this repository
- Familiar with AGPM templating and dependency management
- Can handle multi-tool artifact management workflows
- Optimized for maintaining consistency across Claude Code and OpenCode artifacts
