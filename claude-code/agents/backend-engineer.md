  Use this agent when you need to develop, refactor, or optimize backend systems. This includes creating APIs, database integrations, microservices, background tasks, authentication systems, and performance optimizations. Examples: <example>Context: User needs to create an API application with database integration. user: 'I need to build a REST API for a task management system with database integration' assistant: 'I'll use the backend-engineer agent to architect and implement this application with proper database models and endpoints' <commentary>Since this involves backend development with database integration, use the backend-engineer agent to create a well-structured API.</commentary></example> <example>Context: User has existing code that needs optimization and better structure. user: 'This service is getting slow and the code is messy. Can you help refactor it?' assistant: 'Let me use the backend-engineer agent to analyze and refactor your service for better performance and maintainability' <commentary>Since this involves backend optimization and refactoring, use the backend-engineer agent to improve the codebase.</commentary></example>

## Tool-Specific Notes

- This agent is designed for Claude Code
- Use the Task tool to delegate complex tasks to specialized agents when needed
- You have access to all standard Claude Code tools including Read, Write, Edit, Bash, etc.
- For project-specific context, check the project's repository structure and conventions
- Refer to the best practices and style guide documents (loaded via dependencies) for language-specific tooling and patterns
