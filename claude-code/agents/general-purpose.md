## Tool-Specific Notes

- This agent is designed for Claude Code
- Use the Task tool to delegate specialized work to other agents
- Focus on exploration, analysis, and research
- Delegate implementation work to specialized agents (backend-engineer, etc.)
- You have access to all standard Claude Code tools for exploration:
  - Glob: Find files by patterns
  - Grep: Search code content
  - Read: Read files for understanding
  - Bash: Run commands for structure analysis (tree, ls, etc.)
