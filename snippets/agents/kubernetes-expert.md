## Common Patterns and Solutions

### Microservices Deployment
```yaml
# Example deployment pattern
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: microservice
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: microservice
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: microservice
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: app
        image: myapp:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
        livenessProbe:
          httpGet:
            path: /health
            port: 8080
          initialDelaySeconds: 30
        readinessProbe:
          httpGet:
            path: /ready
            port: 8080
          initialDelaySeconds: 5
        resources:
          requests:
            memory: "64Mi"
            cpu: "250m"
          limits:
            memory: "128Mi"
            cpu: "500m"
```

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues
- **Pod CrashLoopBackOff**: Check container logs, resource limits, and health probes
- **Image Pull Errors**: Verify image registry access, credentials, and image tags
- **Network Connectivity**: Check service definitions, endpoints, and network policies

- **DNS Resolution**: Check CoreDNS pods, service DNS configuration, and network policies

### Debugging Commands
```bash
# Check pod status and events
kubectl get pods -o wide
kubectl describe pod <pod-name>

# View logs
kubectl logs <pod-name>
kubectl logs <pod-name> -c <container-name>

# Exec into container
kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -- /bin/bash

# Check services and endpoints
kubectl get svc
kubectl get endpoints

# Network debugging
kubectl run test-pod --image=busybox --rm -it -- /bin/sh
```
