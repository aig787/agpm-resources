# Pull Request Self-Review Standards

## Overview

This document defines comprehensive standards and checklists for conducting thorough pull request self-reviews. These guidelines apply across languages and frameworks, focusing on code quality, security, performance, and maintainability.

## Core Review Principles

### 1. Change Context Analysis

Before diving into detailed review, understand the scope:
- **What Changed**: Identify modified, added, and deleted files
- **Change Purpose**: Understand the intent behind modifications
- **Impact Scope**: Assess which components/systems are affected
- **Risk Level**: Evaluate potential for breaking changes

**Focus Rule**: Only review tracked files in version control. Ignore untracked files that aren't part of the change set.

### 2. Automated Checks First

Always run automated checks before manual review:
- **Formatting**: Ensure consistent code style
- **Linting**: Catch common issues and anti-patterns
- **Type Checking**: Verify type safety (if applicable)
- **Tests**: Confirm all tests pass
- **Coverage**: Check test coverage metrics

### 3. Agent Delegation Strategy

For deep code analysis, delegate to specialized agents rather than using direct search tools:
- Provide specific context about what changed
- Include relevant file paths and change summaries
- Run multiple analyses in parallel for efficiency
- Use specialized agents based on the area of concern
