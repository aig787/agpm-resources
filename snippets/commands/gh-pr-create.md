# GitHub PR Create Command

## Purpose

Create a GitHub pull request with automatic title and description generation, following conventional commit format and comprehensive PR analysis.

## Execution Steps

### 1. Verify Prerequisites

Check for uncommitted changes to tracked files:
```bash
git diff --quiet && git diff --cached --quiet
```
- If there are uncommitted changes, STOP and inform the user to commit or stash them first

Check if branch exists on remote:
```bash
git ls-remote --heads origin $(git branch --show-current)
```
- If branch doesn't exist on remote, push with: `git push -u origin $(git branch --show-current)`

If branch exists, check if local is ahead:
```bash
git rev-list --count origin/$(git branch --show-current)..HEAD
```
- If local is ahead (count > 0), push with: `git push origin $(git branch --show-current)`

Check that `gh` CLI is installed and authenticated

### 2. Determine Base Branch

- If `--base <branch>` is provided in arguments, use that
- Otherwise, detect from remote: `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref origin/HEAD`
- If that fails, use "main" as default

### 3. Parse Arguments

- Check for `--draft` flag to create a draft PR
- If a PR title is provided (after flags), use it (otherwise generate one)

### 4. Gather PR Information

Get commits in this PR:
```bash
git log origin/<base-branch>..HEAD --oneline
```

Get full diff from base:
```bash
git diff origin/<base-branch>...HEAD
```

### 5. Analyze Changes

Analyze all changes in the PR (NOT just the latest commit!) to determine:
- The primary type of change: feat, fix, docs, test, refactor, chore, build, ci, perf
- The scope (component/module affected)
- The overall purpose and impact

### 6. Generate PR Title

Create a PR title that:
- Follows conventional commit format: `type(scope): description`
- Uses present tense ("add" not "added")
- Is clear and concise (ideally < 72 characters)
- Accurately summarizes the entire PR, not just one commit

### 7. Generate PR Description

Generate a PR description with this structure:
```markdown
## Summary
[2-4 bullet points summarizing what changed and why]

## Changes
[Bulleted list of key changes organized by component/area]

## Test plan
[Bulleted markdown checklist of steps to test the PR]
```

### 8. Create the PR

Use `gh pr create` with appropriate flags:
- Include `--draft` if requested
- Include `--base <branch>` if specified
- Use HEREDOC for the body to ensure proper formatting:
```bash
gh pr create --title "feat(scope): description" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Summary
...
EOF
)"
```

### 9. Report Results

Return the PR URL when successful

## Usage Examples

- Create PR with automatic title and description
- Create draft PR with `--draft` flag
- Create PR against specific base branch with `--base <branch>`
- Create PR with custom title by providing it as argument

## Important Notes

- Always check for uncommitted changes first - abort if any exist
- Check if branch exists on remote using `git ls-remote`, not tracking configuration (important for worktrees)
- Push branch if it doesn't exist on remote or if local is ahead
- Always analyze the FULL diff from base branch, not just the latest commit
- The PR title should summarize the entire PR, considering all commits
- Ensure the description provides clear context for reviewers
- Test plan should be actionable and specific to the changes
