# Squash Command

## Purpose

Squash commits between the specified range into a single commit, with optional intelligent regrouping, or restore from a previous squash operation.

**IMPORTANT**: This command modifies git history. Ensure the branch is not shared or coordinate with team members before proceeding.

**Note**: For complex changes, delegate analysis to specialized agents for better understanding of the codebase implications.

## Arguments

- `<from>`: Starting commit hash or reference (required for squash mode)
- `<to>`: Ending commit hash or reference (required for squash mode)
- `--restore`: Restore from a previous squash operation
- `--regroup`: Enable intelligent regrouping of changes into logical commits
- `--reflog <entry>`: Specific reflog entry to restore to (optional with --restore)

## Execution Steps

### 1. Parse and validate arguments

Check for `--restore` flag first (restore mode):

- **If in restore mode**:
  * Check for optional reflog entry (e.g., `HEAD@{3}` or `ORIG_HEAD`)
  * If no entry specified, find the most recent squash-related operation
- **Otherwise (squash mode)**:
  * Extract `from` commit hash (required first argument)
  * Extract `to` commit hash (required second argument)
  * Check for `--regroup` flag to enable intelligent regrouping
- Validate inputs based on mode

### 2. Restore mode (--restore)

**Consider using checkpoint restore first**:
- Check if checkpoints are available
- If recent checkpoint exists from squash operation, suggest using checkpoint restore
- Checkpoints provide cleaner restoration with better context preservation

**With specific reflog entry**:
- If reflog entry provided (e.g., `HEAD@{3}` or `ORIG_HEAD`):
  * Validate the entry exists
  * Show what will be restored
  * Confirm with user before proceeding
  * Execute restoration
  * Report success and show new HEAD

**Without specific entry (auto-detect)**:
- First check for available checkpoints (preferred method)
- Search reflog for recent squash-related operations
- Look for patterns indicating squash operations:
  - "rebase (start)" or "rebase -i (start)"
  - "reset: moving to" followed by commit refs
  - Previous HEAD positions before these operations
- Present findings to user:
  * Show available checkpoints first (if any)
  * Show last 3-5 potential restore points from reflog
  * Include commit message and timestamp
  * Let user select which one to restore
- Execute restoration or checkpoint restore
- Verify: Show resulting commits and confirm changes are restored

### 3. Analyze the commit range (skip if in restore mode)

- Get list of commits: `git log --oneline <from>..<to>`
- Get detailed changes: `git diff <from> <to>`
- Calculate total files changed and lines modified
- If changes are extensive (>10 files or >500 lines), warn the user

### 4. Squashing strategy (skip if in restore mode)

**Without --regroup flag (default)**:
- Create a single squashed commit with all changes
- Generate commit message following project conventions:
  * Analyze all changes to determine commit type (feat/fix/docs/test/refactor/chore)
  * Create concise message (â‰¤72 chars) that summarizes the overall change
  * Include a body section listing the original commits being squashed
- Analyze the code diff to determine appropriate attribution:
  * Review the actual changes being squashed
  * Apply attribution analysis to determine AI contribution percentage
- Use reset + commit approach:
  ```
  git reset --soft <from>
  # Analyze changes and determine attribution need
  git diff --cached
  git commit -m "type: concise summary

  Squashed commits:
  - original commit 1
  - original commit 2
  ...

  [Include attribution only if analysis shows >25% AI contribution]"
  ```

**With --regroup flag (intelligent regrouping)**:

a. **Analyze changes for logical groupings**:
   - Use specialized agents to analyze the changes
   - Group by these categories:
     * Feature additions (new functionality)
     * Bug fixes (corrections to existing code)
     * Documentation updates
     * Test additions/modifications
     * Refactoring (no functional changes)
     * Dependencies/build configuration
     * CI/CD workflow changes

b. **Identify logical boundaries**:
   - Related files that should be committed together
   - Dependencies between changes
   - Atomic units of work
   - Cross-cutting concerns that span multiple files

c. **Create staged commits with analyzed attribution**:
   - Reset to `from` commit: `git reset --mixed <from>` (use mixed to allow proper staging)
   - For each logical group identified:
     * Stage relevant files: `git add <files>`
     * Analyze the diff to determine AI contribution: `git diff --cached`
     * Apply attribution analysis and thresholds
     * Create commit with appropriate message and attribution
   - Ensure no changes are left unstaged

d. **Example regrouping**:
   ```
   Original: 5 commits with mixed changes
   Regrouped into:
   1. feat: add new resource validation
   2. test: add validation test coverage
   3. docs: update API documentation
   ```

### 5. Commit message generation and attribution

- Analyze changes to determine type prefix (feat/fix/docs/test/refactor/chore)
- Use present tense, be concise (â‰¤72 chars)
- For squashed commits, include summary in body
- **Apply attribution based on code analysis**:
  * Analyze the actual diff using logic and thresholds
  * The squashing operation itself doesn't require attribution - only the actual code changes matter
  * Example attribution when warranted:
    ```

### 6. Safety checks

- Verify working directory is clean before starting
- **Create a checkpoint before squashing**:
  * Use checkpoint create command
  * Use message: "Before squash operation from <from> to <to>"
  * This provides an additional safety net beyond Git's ORIG_HEAD
- Git automatically saves current HEAD to `ORIG_HEAD` before rebase/reset operations
- If operation fails or needs reverting:
  * Use checkpoint restore to return to pre-squash state
  * Or use `git reset --hard ORIG_HEAD` to return to pre-squash state
  * Or check `git reflog` to find the commit before squashing
  * Reset with `git reset --hard HEAD@{n}` where n is the reflog entry
- Never force push without explicit user confirmation
- Inform user about recovery options before starting:
  ```
  Note: A checkpoint will be created before squashing.
  To undo this squash operation, run: checkpoint restore latest
  Alternatively, use: git reset --hard ORIG_HEAD
  Or use git reflog to find and restore any previous state.
  ```

### 7. Final verification

- Show the resulting commit(s): `git log --stat <from>..HEAD`
- Display total changes: `git diff <from> HEAD`
- Confirm all original changes are preserved

## Examples

- `squash HEAD~3 HEAD` - squash last 3 commits into one (creates checkpoint first)
- `squash abc123 def456` - squash commits between abc123 and def456 (creates checkpoint first)
- `squash HEAD~5 HEAD --regroup` - intelligently regroup last 5 commits (creates checkpoint first)
- `squash feature-start HEAD --regroup` - regroup all feature branch commits (creates checkpoint first)
- `squash --restore` - find and restore from most recent squash operation (checks checkpoints first)
- `squash --restore ORIG_HEAD` - restore to ORIG_HEAD (last HEAD change)
- `squash --restore HEAD@{3}` - restore to specific reflog entry
- `checkpoint restore latest` - alternative way to undo last squash if checkpoint was created

## Implementation Guidelines

1. Always create checkpoints before modifying history
2. Use specialized agents for complex change analysis
3. Apply attribution rules consistently based on actual code contributions
4. Provide clear recovery options to users
5. Verify all changes are preserved after operations
6. Warn users about extensive changes before proceeding
